Description:
My program gets teachers names, IDs, and salary, students names, IDs, and grade. It puts them into a list and calculates the amount of money the school 
has earned after paying the salary of a few teachers and some students paying fees.

How to play:
Enter 2 teacher names one at a time, enter their salaries in the same order/way, and enter 2 student names one at a time. It will then ask you which 
student should pay fees, you enter the name from the previous names entered. After it will ask how much the student should pay and you have to enter
a value. Then it will ask which teacher should get paid and you enter a name you previously entered.
